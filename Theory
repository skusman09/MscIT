A z-test is a statistical test used to determine whether two population means are different when the variances are known and the sample size is large

The chi-square test is a statistical tool used to check if two categorical variables are related or independent

A t test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups

The one-way ANOVA is used to compare the means of more than two groups when there is one independent variable and one dependent variable

One way - one independent variable
Two way -two independent variable

Sampling means selecting the group that you will actually collect data from in your research

 Random sampling is a type of probability sampling in which the researcher randomly selects a subset of participants from a population

 In Periodic Sampling a specific interval is fixed from which subset of participants from a population is chosen

 Regression analysis is a set of statistical methods used to estimate relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables

 Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.

 linear regress only has one independent variable impacting the slope of the relationship, 
 multiple regression incorporates multiple independent variables

 Standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean and is calculated as the square root of the variance.

 Variance is a measure of how data points differ from the mean
 Variance means to find the expected difference of deviation from actual value.

 It is calculated by taking the average of squared deviations from the mean
